# List of "pick up and play" video games
I don't have enough time and willingness for most story-driven games (unless they are incredibly good), and
certainly zero patience for IAP-ridden dross. I prefer simpler, "pick-up-and-play" games that can be played
in short intervals; bonus points for lightweight games that can run on just about anything.
Here's a list of such games that I like:

## Sudoku
So portable, it even runs on paper. Digitally speaking, [sudoku.coach](https://sudoku.coach) is currently the
best out there

## Bejeweled 3
The original PC version is an incredible time sink. Not sure how the mobile versions are doing nowadays; last
I remember they were IAP-infested

## Tetris
* 1st place: Tetris DS. The GOAT
* 2nd place: Apotris. Highly customizable clone that has been ported to everything
* 3rd place: Tetris DX. It just feels right
* Honorable mention(s): Tetris Effect

## Modern roguelites
* Brotato
* Vampire Survivors

## Football games
### PS1 era
* Winning Eleven 2002
    * The very last PS1 WE
    * Has a decent English translation patch and well supported by modders
### PS2 era
* Winning Eleven 8: Liveware Evolution
    * The last (and best) version of WE8 with improved AI, animations, refereeing
    * I feel that WE8LE plays the smoothest out of all PS2-era WE/PES games
    * There are no database editing tools. You are gonna have to live a half-bad default database
inside its only English translation (that was used as the base for all modding)
* Pro Evolution Soccer/Winning Eleven 2008
    * A well-balanced PES6 with physicality and pace toned down
    * Has the best AI out of all PS2-era WEs
    * There are some patches floating around on the Internet for it
    * Has an annoying bug with player salaries in Master League mode
* Winning Eleven 10
    * Gameplay feels in between WE9/PES5 and PES6
    * Insanely popular in Brazil and there are too many patches for it, mostly of low quality
    * Almost all modding tools for WE/PES support this version

### PS3/Xbox 360 era
* Pro Evolution Soccer 2013
    * There has never been a football game that can describe player individuality as well as PES2013 did and
probably there will never be anything like it again

### PS4 era
* FIFA 16 (Ignite engine version on PC/PS4/Xbox One)
    * It feels balanced and the least bland out of all modern (PS3-era onwards) FIFAs
    * Great PC modding scene
* PES 2020 (+ 2021 Season Update)
    * After so many years of trying, failing, trying again, Konami managed to make a great modern football game,
only to fuck it all up with that "eFootball" crap
    * Insane PC modding scene
