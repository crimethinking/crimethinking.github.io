# Avoid 1.31.x patches
Pre-Reforged `1.31.x` patches have terrible stutters and spikes in any maps that have memory leaks,
which means almost all custom maps out there

Stay on `1.29.x` and `1.30.x` if you need widescreen support (or go even older and use some Hive
Workshop mods for widescreen); I find `1.30.4` modern enough, supporting both widescreen and high
refresh rate
